Run the following command to compile all classes and launch the unit tests\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}  mvn test
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Or without tests; \begin{DoxyVerb}  mvn clean compile
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Make sure that the database was correctly configured. Use the contents of the file {\itshape create-\/learnify.\+sql} to create the database and grant privileges. For example, \begin{DoxyVerb}  mysql -p --user root < sql/create-learnify.sql
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Alternatively, on Windows, enter My\+SQL shell with root with the following command\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}  mysql -p --user root
  source sql/create-learnify.sql
\end{DoxyVerb}
 The class enhancement required by Data\+Nucleus must be manually executed after the unit testing is performed. This is required to avoid cluttering the Ja\+Co\+Co report with all the methods generated automatically by Data\+Nucleus.

Therefore, execute the following command to enhance the database classes \begin{DoxyVerb}  mvn datanucleus:enhance
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Run the following command to create database schema for this sample. \begin{DoxyVerb}  mvn datanucleus:schema-create
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Run the following command to create the data. \begin{DoxyVerb}  mysql -p --user root < sql/create-data.sql
\end{DoxyVerb}
 On Windows\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}  mysql -p --user root
  source sql/create-data.sql  
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Integration tests can be launched using the following command. An embedded Grizzly HTTP server will be launched to perform real calls to the REST API and to the My\+SQL database. \begin{DoxyVerb}  mvn verify -Pintegration-tests
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Performance tests can be launched using the following command. \begin{DoxyVerb}  mvn verify -Pperformance-tests
\end{DoxyVerb}
 To launch the server run the command \begin{DoxyVerb}  mvn jetty:run
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Now, the client sample code can be executed in a new command window with \begin{DoxyVerb}  mvn exec:java -Pclient
\end{DoxyVerb}
 To generate documentation write\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}  mvn doxygen:report
\end{DoxyVerb}
